= hexy.js -- utility to create hex dumps 

 `hexy` is a javascript library that's easy to use to create hex dumps. It
 works well in node and has cursory browser (more below) support. It contains a
 number of options to configure how the hex dump will end up looking.

 It should create a pleasant looking hex dumb by default:
    
    var hexy = require('hexy'),
           b = new Buffer("\000\001\003\005\037\012\011bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789")
    
    console.log(hexy.hexy(b))

 results in this dump:

    00000000: 0001 0305 1f0a 0962 6364 6566 6768 696a  .......bcdefghij
    00000010: 6b6c 6d6e 6f70 7172 7374 7576 7778 797a  klmnopqrstuvwxyz
    00000020: 3031 3233 3435 3637 3839                 0123456789

 but it's also possible to configure:

  * Line numbering
  * Line width
  * Format of byte grouping
  * Case of hex decimals
  * Presence of the ASCII annotation in the right column.

 This mean it's easy to generate exciting dumps like:

    0000000: 0001 0305 1f0a 0962  .... ...b 
    0000008: 6364 6566 6768 696a  cdef ghij 
    0000010: 6b6c 6d6e 6f70 7172  klmn opqr 
    0000018: 7374 7576 7778 797a  stuv wxyz 
    0000020: 3031 3233 3435 3637  0123 4567 
    0000028: 3839                 89

 or even:

    0000000: 00 01 03 05 1f 0a 09 62   63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6a 
    0000010: 6b 6c 6d 6e 6f 70 71 72   73 74 75 76 77 78 79 7a 
    0000020: 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37   38 39

 with hexy!
 
 Formatting options are configured by passing a `format` object to the `hexy` function:

    var format = {}
        format.width = width // how many bytes per line, default 16
        format.numbering = n // ["hex_bytes" | "none"],  default "hex_bytes"
        format.format = f    // ["fours"|"twos"|"none"], how many nibbles per group
                             //                          default "fours"
        format.caps = c      // ["lower"|"upper"],       default lower
        format.annotate=a    // ["ascii"|"none"], ascii annotation at end of line?
                             //                          default "ascii"
        format.prefix=p      // <string> something pretty to put in front of each line
                             //                          default ""
        format.indent=i      // <num> number of spaces to indent
                             //                          default 0
        format.html=true     // funky html divs 'n stuff! experimental.
                             //                          default: false

    console.log(hexy.hexy(buffer, format))

 In case you're really nerdy, you'll have noticed that the defaults correspond
 to how `xxd` formats it's output.
           

== Installing

 Either use `npm`:
  
    npm install hexy

 This will install the lib which you'll be able to use like so:
    
    var hexy = require("hexy"),
        buf  = // get Buffer from somewhere,
        str  = hexy.hexy(buf)

 It will also install `hexy` into your path in case you're totally fed up
 with using `xxd`.
        
 
 If you don't like `npm`, grab the source from github:

== Browser Support

Basically eveything should work fine in the browser as well, just
include hexy.js in a script tag, and you'll get `hexy` and `Hexy` stuck
to the global object (window).

Some caveats: "Works fine on my systemâ„¢". Browser support is 'new' and
not thoroughly tested (... eh, only on chrome [Version: whatever I'm
currently running]). Under node, I can generally assume that binary data
is passed in in a sane fashion using buffers, but plain old Javascript
doesn't really have any datatypes that can handle bytes gracefully.
Currently only Strings are supported, I'd like to add numeric and typed
arrays.

Let me know in case you run into any issues, I'd be happy to find out
about them.

== TODOS

 The current version only pretty prints node Buffer and JS Strings. This
 should be expanded to also do typed arrays, Streams/series of Buffers
 which would be nice so you don't have to collect the whole things you
 want to pretty print in memory, and such.

 I'd like to improve html rendering, e.g. to be able to mouse over the
 ascii annotation and highlight the hex byte and vice versa, improve
 browser integration and set up a proper build & packaging system.

== History

 This is a fairly straightforward port of `hexy.rb` which does more or less the
 same thing. You can find it here:

 in case these sorts of things interest you.
