= hexy.js -- utility to create hex dumps 

 `hexy` is a javascript (node) library that's easy to use to create hex
 dumps from within node. It contains a number of options to configure
 how the hex dumb will end up looking.

 It should create a pleasant looking hex dumb by default:
    
    var hexy = require('hexy.js'),
           b = new Buffer("\000\001\003\005\037\012\011bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789")
    
    console.log(hexy.hexy(b))

 results in this dump:

    0000000: 00 01 03 05 1f 0a 09 62   63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6a  .......b cdefghij 
    0000010: 6b 6c 6d 6e 6f 70 71 72   73 74 75 76 77 78 79 7a  klmnopqr stuvwxyz 
    0000020: 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37   38 39                    01234567 89

 but it's also possible to configure:

 * Line numbering
 * Line width
 * Format
 * Case of hex decimals
 * Presence of the ASCII annotation in the right column.

 This mean you can do exciting dumps like:

    0000000: 0001 0305 1f0a 0962  .... ...b 
    0000008: 6364 6566 6768 696a  cdef ghij 
    0000010: 6b6c 6d6e 6f70 7172  klmn opqr 
    0000018: 7374 7576 7778 797a  stuv wxyz 
    0000020: 3031 3233 3435 3637  0123 4567 
    0000028: 3839                 89

 or even:

    0000000: 00 01 03 05 1f 0a 09 62   63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6a 
    0000010: 6b 6c 6d 6e 6f 70 71 72   73 74 75 76 77 78 79 7a 
    0000020: 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37   38 39

 with hexy!
                                 

== Installing

 Either use `npm`:
  
    npm install hexy
 
 or grab the source from github:

    http://github.com/a2800276/hexy.js

== TODOS

 The current version only pretty prints Buffers. Which probably means it
 can only be used from within node. What's more important what it
 doesn't support: Strings (which would be nice for the sake of
 completeness) and Streams/series of Buffers which would be nice so you
 don't have to collect the whole things you want to pretty print in
 memory. `hexy` is probably most useful for debugging and getting binary
 protocol stuff working, so that's probably not an too much of an issue.

== History

 This is a fairly straightforward port of `hexy.rb` which does more
 or less the same thing.
